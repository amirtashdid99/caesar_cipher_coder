Wanna write an encrypted message to your "Loved Ones" ?
<br/>First type encode
<br/>then tpe your special message
<br/>then choose a number that you think is meaningful to you as shift
<br/>you'll see a "messed up" encrypted text
<br/>copy that text
<br/>give it to the other person
<br/>ask him/her to type decode at the start of the code this time and paste the given "messed up" text
<br/>and also give her/him the shift number that you used
<br/>then the program will show the intended first message to her/him 
<br/>kinda cool . isn't it ? :)
