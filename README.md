Wanna write an encrypted message to your "Loved Ones" ?
<br/>First type encode
<br/>Then type your special message
<br/>Choose a number that you think is meaningful to you when the program asks you for "shift number"
<br/>You'll see a "messed up" encrypted text
<br/>Copy that text
<br/>Give it to the other person
<br/>Ask him/her to type decode at the start of the code this time and paste the given "messed up" text
<br/>And also give her/him the shift number that you used
<br/>Then the program will show the intended first message to her/him 
<br/>Kinda cool , isn't it ? :)
